    <h1>Ron Cherny</h1>
    <p> I am an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo studying Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics.
        In Spring 2023 I worked under 
        <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~msatrian/index.html" target="_blank">
            Matthew Satriano
        </a>
        together with 
        <a href="https://www.student.math.uwaterloo.ca/~y343song/https://www.student.math.uwaterloo.ca/~y343song/" target="_blank">
            Yohan Song
        </a>
        on a combinatorial instance of the Gerstenhaber problem. 
        Later on, in Winter 2025 I worked under
        <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~opecheni/" target="_blank">
            Oliver Pechenik
        </a>
        together with

            Stephan Pfannerer
        </a>
        , trying to understand the structure of promotion permutations.
        In the upcoming Fall 2025 I will worke under

    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <p> I gave a talk about the Gerstenhaber problem, which asks if the dimension of the algebra generated by 3 commuting n by n matrices is less than n.
