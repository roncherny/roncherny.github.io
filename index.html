    <p> I am an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo studying Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics</p>
    <p> I gave a talk about the Gerstenhaber Problem, which is asks if the dimension of the algebra generated by 3 commuting n by n matrices is less than n. Here is a link to the slides <a href="Gerstenhaber talk - slides.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> </p>
