        I am an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo studying Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I am currently working under the supervision of 
            <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~m3kenned/" target="_blank">Matthew Kennedy</a>, 
            exploring applications of the non-commutative convexity framework in various areas of mathematics. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I have also been supervised by 
            <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~opecheni/" target="_blank">Oliver Pechenik</a>
            together with 
            <a href="https://stephan.pfannerer-mittas.net/" target="_blank">Stephan Pfannerer</a>, 
            investigating the structure of promotion permutations. These permutations arise naturally from recording
            row indices during the promotion process on rectangular Young tableaux. We are interested in these permutations 
            because they appear to encode combinatorial data underlying a correspondence between rectangular Young tableaux 
            and web diagrams. Such web diagrams are used to study invariant spaces of representations of the quantum group 
            $U_q(\mathrm{SL}_r)$, providing a diagrammatic framework for constructing rotation-invariant bases.
        </li>
        <li>
            I collaborated with Yohan Song under the supervision of
            <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~msatrian/index.html" target="_blank">Matthew Satriano</a>
            on a combinatorial instance of the Gerstenhaber problem. The problem asks whether, given three commuting 
            $n \times n$ matrices, the dimension of the algebra they generate is always bounded by $n$. We proved this 
            bound holds for a broad class of matrices generated from certain combinatorial structures.

    </ul>

    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I presented a talk on the Gerstenhaber problem in the Algebraic and Enumerative Combinatorics 
            <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/events/algebraic-enumerative-combinatorics-connor-baetz-arnav-kumar" target="_blank">seminar</a> 
            at the University of Waterloo, focusing on whether the dimension of the algebra generated by three commuting 
            $n \times n$ matrices is less than $n$.

        </li>
        <li>
            I also gave a talk on extending the framework of the first rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathrm{SL}_4)$ web basis 
            to higher rank, by studying promotion permutations and extracting structural information about the webs. 
            This talk was presented at <a href="https://canadam.ca/2025schedule" target="_blank">CanaDAM 2025</a> 
            in the Web Graphs session.
