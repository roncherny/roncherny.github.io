    <h1>Ron Cherny</h1>

    <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo studying Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Spring 2023, I worked under 
        <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~msatrian/index.html" target="_blank">Matthew Satriano</a>
        together with 
        <a href="https://www.student.math.uwaterloo.ca/~y343song/" target="_blank">Yohan Song</a>
        on a combinatorial instance of the Gerstenhaber problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Winter 2025, I worked under 
        <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~opecheni/" target="_blank">Oliver Pechenik</a>
        together with 
        <a href="https://stephan.pfannerer-mittas.net/" target="_blank">Stephan Pfannerer</a>,
        trying to understand the structure of promotion permutations.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the upcoming Fall 2025, I will work under 
        <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~m3kenned/" target="_blank">Matthew Kennedy</a>.

    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <p>
        I gave a talk about the Gerstenhaber problem, which asks whether the dimension of the algebra 
        generated by three commuting n &times; n matrices is less than n.
